# Push Policy Bundle

Like our code, we also want to do some validation on the Kubernetes
artifacts we're using to run it. The tool `conftest` runs OPA policies
against a set of files to validate that they are compliant. Our 
pipeline includes a step that runs a set of policies against the 
Kubernetes manifests we use to deploy the Petclinic application.

The `conftest` task in the pipeline uses an OPA bundle from the 
private registry. We need to push the bundle the Harbor (which can 
store it because it's OCI-compliant) before we run the pipeline.

## Run the Push Policy Script

The script `push-policies.sh` uses Docker to invoke `conftest` and 
push a policy bundle to the registry.

```
push-policies.sh
```

All policies in the directoy `conftest/policy` will be pushed, so
you can add your own if there's something you'd like to highlight in
your demonstration. The policies I've created are the same ones 
enforced at runtime using TMC's custom policy capabilities.
